#Charles G., Jack L.

a) This is a simple program to calculate the walking, biking, or flying (in a Boeing 747) distance between two different buildings on a map of UCSB's campus.

b) As a user I can check boxes so that I can calculate walking, biking, and flying distance from one place to the next. As a programmer I can change private variables so that I can modify the speed with which I walk, bike, fly with.

c) The software runs as intended and provides walknig, biking and flying distances.

d) As a user I can have the option to change my walking speed so that I can more accurately calculate my actual walking time. As a programmer I can add other the option to drive so that if someone needs to calculate the time it takes to drive from one place to the next, the option is available. As a programmer I can add a UCSB GOLD API so that students can open the program on GOLD for easier access. As a programmer I can make the program draw lines and shortcuts on the map so that users can interact more with the program and get places more efficiently.

e) The current quality of the README.md is proficient, but we could separate the ant compile and the ant run.

f) Yes, there are targets that need descriptions: javadoc and download to name a few. No, there is nothing that needs to be removed.

g) There are a variety of current issues, and definitely enough so that I could earn 1000 points on this project. The issues are sufficiently clear in terms of what the expectations are.

h) One option we added was to modify speed and mode of transportation: https://github.com/UCSB-CS56-Projects/cs56-calculatewalkingtime/issues/27. Another we added was to add physical travelling lines on the map, given here: https://github.com/UCSB-CS56-Projects/cs56-calculatewalkingtime/issues/28.

i) The code is well organized, all the methods have comments attached specifying exactly what they accomplish, and the purpose of the classes and methods are clear and do not need comments. It is obvious how one class relates to another as their only difference is a change in the variables. The code is simple and if I had to give one screenful of text to get a programmer up to speed, I would include details on a constructor to initialize buildings and variables, classes to call those functions to calculate distance, basic functions to calculate distance and last but not least the main function to open the map GUI as well as the purpose of the program.

j) There is no test coverage; no JUnit tests, etc. There are opportunities to test; for example, you could test three check boxes, but for the most part there is no need for computerized testing.
